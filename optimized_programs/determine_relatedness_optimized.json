Given a codebase symbol, a detailed explanation of the symbol's functionality, and a specific task related to enhancing the HVM3 runtime system (a parallel, graph-based computational model), determine whether the codebase symbol is essential context for completing the task.  Provide a detailed rationale explaining your decision, and express your confidence in your assessment as a probability score between 0.0 and 1.0.  The rationale should clearly articulate the connection (or lack thereof) between the symbol and the task, considering the broader context of the HVM3 system.",
