Specifically, we need to change the Lab field of CTRs to store only the Constructor ID (CID), and move the arity information to a global static object in the C code. This change aims to optimize memory usage and potentially improve performance.\n\nGiven the blocks provided, there are no direct modifications required for this task. The shown code snippets are related to flattening and collapsing operations, module imports, and general utility functions. These parts of the code don't directly interact with the CTR representation or the Lab field.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that changes to the CTR representation might have indirect effects on other parts of the codebase, including these sections. For example, if the flattening or collapsing operations rely on arity information, they might need to be updated to use the new global static object for arity lookup instead of extracting it from the Lab field.",
