This change will require updates to both the Haskell frontend and the C backend. In the Haskell frontend, the `Lab` field of `CTR` terms must be updated to store only the `CID`, and the arity information must be removed.

This means that all references to native number types (e.g., `u32`, `u64`, `W32`, etc.) and their associated operations must be eliminated. This will require identifying and modifying all parts of the codebase that rely on native numbers, including data structures, reduction functions, and compilation logic. The removal of native numbers will likely necessitate the introduction of alternative representations for numerical values, such as Church numerals or other functional encodings.",
      "reasoning": "The block directly references `W32` and `CHR` tags, which are part of the native number feature. Since the task is to remove native numbers entirely, this block must be modified to exclude these cases. The `reduceOpxW32` function, which is called in these cases, is also part of the native number handling logic and will need to be removed or refactored. Therefore, this block requires direct modification to align with the task's goal of removing native numbers.",

Currently, the `Lab` field of a CTR term stores both the constructor ID (CID) and the arity, encoded together using the `u12v2` encoding scheme. The task requires moving the arity out of the `Lab` field and into a global static object in C, so that the `Lab` field only stores the CID. This change will require updates to the code that interacts with CTR terms, particularly where the arity is extracted or used.",
      "reasoning": "The block in question (`u12v2_x`) is a utility function that extracts the lower 12 bits from a 64-bit value, which is currently used to extract the CID from the `Lab` field. Since the task involves changing how the `Lab` field is structured (removing the arity and leaving only the CID), this function will need to be modified to reflect the new structure. Specifically, the function will no longer need to mask the lower 12 bits, as the entire `Lab` field will now contain only the CID. Therefore, this block requires direct modification to align with the new metadata storage scheme.",

This will require changes to the interaction counting logic, likely in the C backend, to categorize and store counts for each interaction type. Additionally, the Haskell frontend will need updates to report these segmented results, possibly by extending the `State` structure or adding new data structures to hold the segmented counts.",

Currently, this function does not increment any interaction counters, as it immediately exits with an error message. To implement the task, this function would need to be modified to increment a counter specific to `MAT-LAM` interactions before exiting. However, since the function is currently designed to handle an invalid case and exit, it is unclear whether this block will remain relevant after the task is implemented. If the `MAT-LAM` interaction type is valid in the updated system, this block will require direct modification to increment the appropriate counter. If it remains invalid, no modification is needed.
