make CTRs store only the CID in the Lab field, and move the arity to a global static object in C
extend the size of the addr field on runtime nodes from 32 to 40 bits, and reduce the label field from 24 to 16 bits
completely remove native numbers as a feature
remove the list/string pretty printers
measure interactions by interaction type instead of just storing the total count. report results segmented by interaction type
implement a very simple #import file.hvml feature. an import will just load and inline a different file into the current file.
implement a feature that prevents the user from creating two constructors with the same name. show a helpful error when that happens.
clean up every commented-out line of code ("garbage collect" the codebase)
add Tup and Get constructors. Tup behaves similarly to a superposition of label 0, and is represented as (a,b). Get behaves similarly to a duplication with label 0, and is represented as ! (a,b) = x
extend Lam and App nodes to also store a label, just like Sups and Dups. the App-Lam rule must be updated so that, when the labels are different, the nodes will commute instead of beta-reducing
replace the 'Î»x body' syntax by '\x body'
