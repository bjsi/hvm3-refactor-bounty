    "reasoning": "The `compileFullCore` function in BLOCK 79 is responsible for compiling `Core` terms into C code. While the block itself does not explicitly show the handling of native numbers, the `Core` data type likely includes constructors for numeric literals (e.g., `U32`, `U64`). Removing native numbers as a feature would require modifying `compileFullCore` to no longer handle these numeric constructors. Additionally, the function's interaction with the `Book` and `Word64` parameters suggests that it may indirectly depend on numeric types for memory management or other purposes. Therefore, this block will require direct modification to align with the removal of native numbers.",

Since the task is to remove native numbers as a feature, this block will need to be modified to remove `Data.Word` and any other imports that are no longer necessary due to the removal of native numbers. While this block does not contain code that directly manipulates native numbers, the removal of native numbers as a feature necessitates cleaning up the imports to reflect the new design.

These operators are typically used with native numbers. Since the task requires removing native numbers as a feature, the parsing logic for these operators must be modified or removed entirely. Specifically, the `parseOper` calls for arithmetic operators (`OP_ADD`, `OP_SUB`, `OP_MUL`, `OP_DIV`, `OP_MOD`) should be removed, as they are no longer relevant without native numbers. Additionally, the logic for parsing comparison operators (`OP_EQ`, `OP_NE`, `OP_LTE`, `OP_GTE`, etc.) and bitwise operators (`OP_AND`, `OP_OR`, `OP_XOR`, `OP_LSH`, `OP_RSH`) may also need to be reviewed, as these operators are often used with numeric types. However, if these operators are still needed for other purposes (e.g., working with non-numeric types), they may be retained. The block must be directly modified to reflect these changes.",

The function's core logic involves iterating over memory addresses and checking heap values, which currently depends on native number types. To align with the task, the function must be updated to use an alternative representation for memory addresses and heap values, such as symbolic or custom types.
