# HVM Large Refactor Bounty

Develop an AI tool that, given the current snapshot of HVM3's codebase and a refactor request, correctly assigns which chunks must be updated, in order to fulfill that request. The AI tool must use at most $1 to complete this task, while achieving a recall of at least 90% and a precision of at least 90%.

## Setup

- Clone the repo + submodules.
- `python3 -m venv env`
- `source env/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `npm install tree-sitter`
- Create a `.env` file with an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
